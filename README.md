# To build this page I used:

## Webpack

Main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser. It is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset - so I also used it to  load CSS files, EJS templates and plain HTML files with suitable loaders

## JavaScript ES6

- Classes

- Property descriptors present in objects

- Arrow functions

- Immutability - frozen objects

## Axios

Promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser

## EJS

Embedded JavaScript templates - templating language that lets generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript

## CSS

### PostCSS

Node.js package which transform all of CSS using JavaScript, thereby achieving much  **faster**  build times than other processors.  
PostCSS plugins allows using variables, mixins, imports - the same way as in  **Sass**  CSS extension language

### Autoprefixer

a PostCSS plugin which parses CSS and adds vendor prefixes

### Normalize.css

Node.js package which makes  browsers render all elements more consistently  and in line with modern standards

### Block Element Modifier methodology

BEM’s naming convention and independent blocks make code reusable and modular

### Mobile First approach

layout was created in a way where  the default configuration is for narrow screen/mobile devices, and layout features for wider viewports are then layered on top of that default helps achieve better performance

### Responsive Images

the point of responsive images is loading  the smallest, most impactful resource

### Lazy loading of images

loading of images on a page - when those images are actually needed, instead of loading them up front
